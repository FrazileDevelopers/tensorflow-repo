You might be used to thinking of neural network training and inference as requiring beefy GPUs,
running a big data center or maybe a big GPU at least in your desktop. But modern web browsers have come a long
ways and modern computers are quite fast and web browsers are now full flesh runtime environments. 

One of the exciting things about JS is that it allows you to do neural network training and
inference right there in your web browser. 

And the performance is amazingly good too. So even if you're training when the
browser and your desktop has a GP on it with the webgl layer, you can get
some really really nice performance. And we're going to be having some fun
with some scenarios around that later in the course. 

So I think it's really cool that a user can upload a picture to a web browser or grab an image from a webcam. 
And then have a neural network do training or inference right in the web browser without needing to send that image up to
the cloud to be processed by a server. 

Yeah, so you're going to save time on the round tripping or if in a scenario if you're doing it on mobile for example
that you don't even need to be connected. Possess user privacy as well and for some applications that's important. 
And so in this course you learn how to do all this yourself. Please go on to the next video.
